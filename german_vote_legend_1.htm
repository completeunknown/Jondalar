<h1 class="magazine">The Legendary English-Only Vote of 1795</h1>

<div class="magazine">
<p class="first_letter"> In April, 1987, an election judge from
Missouri wrote to Ann Landers citing the following excerpt from the local
Election Manual to support the argument that everyone's vote counts: “In 1776,
one vote gave America the English language instead of German.” The statement is
not strictly true, as many of Landers' more alert readers quickly pointed out.
The vote in question did not take place. However, language became a political
and an emotional issue as early as the 1750s, when British settlers in
Pennsylvania began to fear and resent the fact that a third of their fellow
Pennsylvanians were German speakers.  </p>

<p> Since that time, American nativists have
sought to eradicate minority languages and discourage bilingualism wherever it
could be found: in Maine and Louisiana, California and New Mexico, Hawaii and
Puerto Rico, as well as in Pennsylvania. Complaints about Germans as well as
other non-English-speakers became all too common in the last quarter of the 19th
century, and again during and after World War I, when the fear of immigrants
and their languages prompted protective English-only legislation. Many
Americans considered nonanglophones to be less than human: in 1904 a railroad
president told a congressional hearing on the mistreatment of immigrant
workers, “These workers don't suffer—they don't even speak English” (Shanahan,
1989.) Today as well there is opposition to nonanglophones and bilinguals—this
time not Germans but Hispanic and Asian Americans. The result is the proposed
English Language Amendment (ELA), a Constitutional amendment making English the
official language of the United States. 
   </p>

<p> Despite the latest rehearsal in Ann Landers'
advice column of the myth that German had once come close to replacing English
in the United States, Americans have never had a legally-established official
language. The so-called German vote did not take place in 1776, and it had
nothing to do with privileging German over English. The legend that it did,
which has gone around since at least the 1850s, was spread initially by
propagandists celebrating German contributions to American culture. It has
since been taken over by those who claim that the English language in the
United States is an endangered species. The story of the German Vote is
occasionally trotted out by ELA supporters to demonstrate the power of ethnic
groups to subvert national unity and to warn Americans that although the German
threat to English has been defused, the Spanish one has not.  </p>

<p> The events whose misinterpretation gave rise
to the legend of the German vote occurred in 1795, though the date is
frequently changed to the more patriotically crucial year of 1776. As is
characteristic of such stories, what actually occurred is not entirely clear.
What is clear is that Congress never considered replacing English with any
other language or giving any other tongue equal status with English. In the
18th century there were rumors that a few Brit-bashing superpatriots campaigned
to have the new nation drop English in favor of Hebrew, French, or Greek,
considered in the late 18th century to be the languages of God, rationality,
and democracy, respectively. But the desire to found a New Eden rather than a
New Babel assured that the United States would be united both legally and
socially under a single language, and that language would be English. Noah
Webster championed a dialect-free Federal English based on his spelling book (and his own New England dialect).
John Adams rightly predicted that English would become the next world language.
And Roger Sherman of Connecticut is reported to have urged Americans to retain
English and make the British speak Greek. (See Baron, 1982.) Despite the solid
position of English both initially and throughout American history, the legend
of the German vote persists.

 <b>The German Vote</b>

<p class="first_letter"> On January 13, 1795, Congress considered a
proposal, not to give German any official status, but merely to print the
federal laws in German as well as English. During the debate, a motion to
adjourn failed by one vote. The final vote rejecting the translation of federal
laws, which took place one month later, is not recorded.  </p>

<p> The translation proposal itself originated
as a petition to Congress on March 20, 1794, from a group of Germans living in
Augusta, Virginia. A House committee responding to that petition recommended
publishing sets of the federal statutes in English and distributing them to the
states, together with the publication of three thousand sets of laws in German,
“for the accommodation of such German citizens of the United States, as do not
understand the English language” (American State Papers ser. 10, v. 1:114).
According to the succinct report in the Aurora Gazette, “A great variety of
plans were proposed, but none that seemed to meet the general sense of the
House” (22 January, 1795, p. 3). </p>
