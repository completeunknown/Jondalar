<p class="first_letter"> A vote to adjourn and sit again on the
recommendation failed, 42 to 41, but there is no reason to believe from this
close vote that more than token support existed for publishing the laws in
German. The vote to adjourn seems to have been interpreted by the House as a
vote of no confidence both in the committee's recommendation to translate the
laws and in its recommendation on the distribution of the sets of laws once
they were published in English. While there is no record of debate on the
translation provision that day, if sentiment on the issue in Congress was
anything like sentiment in Pennsylvania, translation was probably opposed by a
substantial majority of the representatives.  </p>

<p> On the other hand, the committee's plan for
distributing the sets of laws did provoke some strong disagreement in the
House. After objections to the latter were aired, a new committee was formed
and asked to report again, and the House agreed to adjourn. It is from the
close interim vote, not on an actual bill but on adjournment, that the socalled
“German vote” legend has been built.  </p>

<p> One month later, on February 16, 1795, the
House once again considered the question of promulgating the laws, and among
the issues, once again, was translating the federal statutes into German. This
time some of the actual debate has been preserved. Rep. Thomas Hartley of
Pennsylvania argued that “it was perhaps desirable that the Germans should
learn English; but if it is our object to give present information, we should
do it in the language understood. The Germans who are advanced in years cannot
learn our language in a day. It would be generous in the Government to inform
those persons. Many honest men, in the late disturbances [the Whiskey
Rebellion], were led away by misrepresentation; ignorance of the laws laid them
open to deception.”  </p>

<p> Rep. William V. Murray of Maryland, who
opposed translating the laws into German, countered “that it had never been the
custom in England to translate the laws into Welsh or Gaelic, and yet the great
bulk of the Welsh, and some hundred thousands of people in Scotland, did not
understand a word of English” (Annals of Congress 4:1228-29). The House finally
approved publication of current statutes, as well as future ones, in English only.
The bill was agreed to by the Senate and signed by President Washington the
following month. 
     </p>

<p> The January vote on adjournment is sometimes
known as “the Muhlenberg Vote,” after the Speaker of the House of
Representatives, Pennsylvania's Frederick Augustus Muhlenberg, a Federalist who
spoke German with difficulty, so it is claimed, and who was at any rate a
member of a prominent family of assimilated Germans who favored English as the
language of education and religion (Dorpalen 1942, 178). Although the roll call
vote does not survive, tradition has it that Muhlenberg stepped down to cast
the deciding negative, thereby dooming German in America to minority-language
status. Tradition notwithstanding, too much weight should not be given to the
fact that the Speaker was not in the chair on this occasion. It was common for
the Speaker to step down, and Muhlenburg did so on many other occasions during
the Third Congress. Even a positive vote on the adjournment issue could not
have led to approval of German translations of the laws, a concession which the
Congress has repeatedly refused to make ever since.  </p>

<p> Nonetheless, Muhlenberg was blamed for
selling out German language interests by Franz Lher, whose 1847<i> History and
Achievements of the Germans in America</i>  
presents a garbled though frequently cited account of what is supposed to have
happened. Lher places the crucial language vote not in the U.S. Congress, but
in the Pennsylvania legislature, over which Muhlenberg had earlier presided.
There is no evidence as to Muhlenberg's actual views on German publishing; no
evidence that he cast a tie-breaking vote on the matter; and no contemporary
indication that the German community was displeased with his stewardship over
the Third Congress. However, Muhlenberg later did manage to irritate his German
constituents by casting the deciding vote in favor of the Jay Treaty during the
Fourth Congress, a move which drove his brother-in-law to stab him and which
cost him the next election in 1796. This significant tie-breaker soon became
confused with the earlier adjournment cliff-hanger, conveniently fleshing out
the myth of the German vote (Feer 1952, 401).  </p>

<b>Official English Then and Now</b>

<p class="first_letter"> Opponents of moves to make English the
official language of the United States frequently suspect that English-only
advocates are motivated by more than political idealism. This suspicion is
certainly justified by the historical record. For the past two centuries,
proponents of official-English have sounded two separate themes, one rational
and patriotic, the other emotional and racist. The Enlightenment belief that
language and nation are inextricably intertwined, coupled with the chauvinist
notion that English is a language particularly suited to democratically
constituted societies, are convincing to many Americans who find discrimination
on non-linguistic grounds thoroughly reprehensible (see Baron, 1990). More
prominent though, throughout American history, have been the nativist attacks on
minority languages and their speakers: Native Americans, Asians, the French,
Germans, Jews and Hispanics, to name only the most frequently-targeted groups.  </p>
