<p class="first_letter"> The English-only nativists who attacked the
Germans used arguments similar to those heard nowadays against newer
immigrants. Benjamin Franklin considered the Pennsylvania Germans to be a
“swarthy” racial group distinct from the English majority in the colony. In
1751 he complained, “Why should the Palatine Boors be suffered to swarm into
our Settlements, and by herding together establish their Language and Manners
to the exclusion of ours? Why should Pennsylvania, founded by the English,
become a Colony of Aliens, who will shortly be so numerous as to Germanize us
instead of our Anglifying them, and will never adopt our Language or Customs,
any more than they can acquire our Complexion?” (<em>The papers of Benjamin
Franklin. </em>Ed. Leonard W. Labaree. New Haven: Yale Univ. Press, 1959. vol
4:234). </p>

<p> The Germans were accused by other
eighteenth-century Anglos of laziness, illiteracy, clannishness, a reluctance
to assimilate, excessive fertility, and Catholicism. They were even blamed for
the severe Pennsylvania winters (Feer 1952, 403; Mittelberger 1898, 104). Most
irritating to Pennsylvania's English-firsters in the latter 1700s was German
language loyalty, although it was clear that, despite community efforts to
preserve their language, Germans were adopting English and abandoning German at
a rate that should have impressed the rest of the English-speaking population. 
     </p>

<p> Anti-German sentiment spread along with
German immigration, and the nation as a whole resisted both the German
bilingual schools that were established in parts of the Midwest in the 19th
century and the common practice of publishing legal notices in German-American
newspapers. On a number of occasions the U.S. Congress again rejected motions
to print laws or other documents in German as well as English. The motions were
often treated jocularly and were shouted down amidst racist cries of, “What! In
the Cherokee? [and in] the Old Congo language!” (<i>Congressional Globe</i> 1844, 7). 
 </p>

<p> Antagonism toward Germans and their language
resurfaced in the Midwest in the late 1880s and early 1890s, and again across
the country during and after World War I. Between 1917 and 1922 most of the
states dropped German from their school curricula. Nebraska's open meeting law
of 1919 forbade the use of foreign languages in public, and in 1918 Governor
Harding of Iowa proclaimed that “English should and must be the only medium of
instruction in public, private, denominational and other similar schools.
Conversation in public places, on trains, and over the telephone should be in
the English language. Let those who cannot speak or understand the English
language conduct their religious worship in their home” (<i>New York Times,</i>  
18 June 1918, p. 12). Such attitudes had a chilling
effect on language use. As many as eighteen thousand people were charged in the
Midwest during and immediately following World War I with violating the English-only
statutes (Crawford 1989, 23.) 
</p>

<p> The anti-German school laws were declared
unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1923. In Meyer v. Nebraska, the
court ruled that “the protection of the Constitution extends to all,—to those
who speak other languages as well as to those born with English on the tongue”
(262 U.S. 390). Similar anti-Japanese laws were invalidated by the court in
Farrington v. Tokushige in 1927 (273 U.S. 284). And the high court reaffirmed
the states' responsibility to educate non-English speakers effectively in Lau
v. Nichols (1974) (414 U.S. Reports 563), though the court did not specify how
this was to be accomplished. 
     </p>

<p> Nonetheless, Americans remain troubled by
foreign languages and their speakers. Despite the fact that the 1980 U.S.
Census showed that more than 97 percent of the people in the nation speak
English (Waggoner 1988, 69), nativist fears for the safety of English seem
stronger than ever. The English Language Amendment (ELA) has been before the
Congress since 1981. California passed an official-English law in 1986, a year
in which a total of thirty-seven states considered official language measures.
In 1989 Arizona, Colorado and Florida passed English-only laws, and votes on
the issue are likely in Massachusetts, Ohio and Pennsylvania in the near
future. Today's attempts to suppress the use of Asian languages and Spanish in
the United States are manifest in state official-language referenda; in local
ordinances mandating the use of the roman alphabet on signboards or forbidding
the purchase of non-English books by public libraries; and in regulations which
require employees to use English on the job and during breaks, or which force
school children to use English in schoolbuses as well as classrooms. 
   </p>

<p> Official-English is an emotional issue for
many people, involving questions of patriotism as well as racism, language
loyalty as well as assimilation. Supporters and opponents of the ELA almost
came to blows during a discussion of the subject on the “Donahue” show in Miami
a few years ago. Adding to the complexity of the issue is the problem that
language legislation, at least in the United States, is difficult if not
impossible to enforce. In 1906, Pres. Theodore Roosevelt ordered the federal
government to adopt simplified spelling in its official publications. This move
generated so much resistance that Roosevelt softly withdrew his order (see
Baron, 1982). The New Mexico constitution, establishing English as the new
state's official language, was ratified by means of bilingual ballots. A 1923
Illinois law making American, rather than English, the official language of
that state was quietly amended in 1969 because Illinois residents continued to
speak and teach English in defiance or ignorance of the statute. The English
Language Amendment, if it is passed, may also prove to be more of a symbol than
an enforceable statute, though many people fear that it could become a
dangerous tool for linguistic and cultural repression. In any case, though, the
ELA seems one final, and to some observers, paranoid, attempt to make up for
the perceived humiliation of 1795, when English reportedly came within a
hair's-breadth of losing out as the official language of the United States in a
vote which never really took place.
